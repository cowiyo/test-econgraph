# test-econgraph
first tester for vizualizations

This is another test; here's the visualization:
<div id="graph" class="kg-container" clearColor="#ffffff" src="/topics/scarcity/ppf/prod_fns_ppf_curved.yml">
{% include graph.html category="intro-trade-offs-one-entity" graph="custom_prod_fns_ppf_curved" %}
Let's hope this works!
